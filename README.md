webofneeds
==========

Prototypical implementation of all required components of the web of needs.

Web of Needs is a new idea based on old technology, enabling a recent field of research.
Central Point is the need. In contrast to the offer, the need is inadequately represented.
Web of needs tries to fill the gap. 

For further information have a look at: http://webofneeds.org

Web of needs is build up of 
won-node
won-owner 
and matching-service.

Requirements for getting started:
- jdk 1.6 or later
- maven 2 or later
- tomcat 6 or later as application-server

To prevent reinventing the wheel every single day, 
we come back to existing (old) technology for the matching services:
 siren -> http://siren.sindice.com/ 
 triplestore(virtuoso) -> http://virtuoso.openlinksw.com/
 solr, -> http://lucene.apache.org/solr/
 ldspider -> https://code.google.com/p/ldspider/
