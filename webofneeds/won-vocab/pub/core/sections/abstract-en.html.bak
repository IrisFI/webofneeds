<h2>Abstract</h2><span class="markdown">
The Web of Needs is a decentralized linked data application infrastructure for mediating cooperation in the broadest sense. Based on append-only message logs, users (or other agents) publish objects (*Atoms*) that can establish *Connections*  with other Atoms. Matching services can make suggestions which atoms to connect to. An Atom specifies 'Sockets' indicating the kinds of Connections it is prepared to establish.</span>
