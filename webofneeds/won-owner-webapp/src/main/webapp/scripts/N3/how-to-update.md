1. go to some folder outside of the webofneeds-project
2.
```
git clone git@github.com:RubenVerborgh/N3.js.git
cd N3.js 
npm install 
npm run browser
```
3. go to the `./browser/`-folder in the repo and copy the built files, paste them into the folder containing this "how-to-update".
4. commit them to the git :|

TODO if we keep using N3 / use it in a more major capacity than just developer-features, we should add a task to the npm-postinstall, that executes the steps mentioned above and uses a fixed N3-version.
