<h2>Abstract</h2><span class="markdown">
This ontology defines properties commonly used in the content of Messages and Atoms, in parallel to the [WoN Matching Ontology](https://w3id.org/won/matching). That does not mean that these are the only properties that can be used in messages. The content of a message (i.e., the triples in any of its ContentGraphs) is unrestricted, except for the rule that no part of the [WoN Message vocabulary](https://w3id.org/won/message) may be used in the content.</span>
