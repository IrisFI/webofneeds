The project defines a number of ontologies, available in the URI space below https://w3id.org/won/. 

* [https://w3id.org/won/core](https://w3id.org/won/core) - This ontology is used to describe WoN nodes, Atoms, and Connections
* [https://w3id.org/won/message](https://w3id.org/won/message) - This ontology is used for specifying messages.

The ontology URIs redirect to the latest release of the respective ontology. All ontologies are hosted in the [GitHub page of this repository](http://researchstudio-sat.github.io/webofneeds/) -  (the `gh-pages` branch), their sources are in the [won-vocab module of this projct](/webofneeds/won-vocab).
