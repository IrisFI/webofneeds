# Matching Contexts

Hashtags on Twitter have shown that naming the context of a postings can be a great tool for structuring user-generated information. A very powerful property of hashtags is that they are freely usable by the authors of a posting. A striking difference, however, between Twitter and Web of Needs is that in WoN, postings are matched with each other. The role of hashtags is unclear in such a setting. 

In an attempt to provide a tool similar to the Twitter hashtag for WoN, we suggest the notion of a 'matching context' - a user-definable string (or set of strings) that restricts the postings that matchers will report as relevant: only those target postings that define one of the original posting's context names should be reported as matches. Postings that do not define matching contexts do not restrict the set of potential matches.
