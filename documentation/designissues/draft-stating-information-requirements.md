# Stating Information Requirements

This document describes a possible approach for how owners can request information from their counterparts.

The basic idea is that an owner uses SHACL shapes to specify their information needs. The counterpart then adds data to their communication channel (the connection) or invalidates already added data until the valid data in the channel can be validated by the shape.  

## Variants
Shapes can be used in needs in the following ways:
1. /pre-matching/ - as part of the need description
1. /post-matching/, i.e. during a conversation 
### pre-matching 
1. To specify matching constraints.  This is the case if 
    1. The shape is attached to a `won:seeks` node of the need
    1. The shape specifies the `sh:severity` `sh:Violation` 
    1. such shapes should cause non-matching needs to be filtered out while matching
1. To specify preferences. This is the case if
    1. The shape is attached to a `won:seeks` node of the need
    1. The shape specifies the `sh:severity` `sh:Warning` 
    1. such shapes should cause a penalty for matched needs that do not conform to the shape
1. To specify properties of interest. This is the case if
    1. The shape is attached to a `won:seeks` node of the need
    1. The shape specifies the `sh:severity` `sh:Info` 
    1. such shapes should cause a boost for matched needs that specify the property
1. To specify information required from the counterpart so as to be able to perform an action. This could also be called service specification. This is the case if
    1. The shape is attached to a `won:performs` node that describes an operation the need is able to provide
    1. In this case, the shape's `sh:Severity` is used to convey mandatory (`sh:Violation`) or optional (`sh:Warning`) parameters
    
### post-matching
In this case, the shape is embedded in the content of a message.
1. To specify information required from the counterpart so as to be able to perform an action. This could also be called service specification. This is the case if
    1. The shape is attached to a `[needuri]/won:performs` node that describes an operation the need is able to provide
    1. In this case, the shape's `sh:Severity` is used to convey mandatory (`sh:Violation`) or optional (`sh:Warning`) parameters
1. To specify properties of interest after matching. This is the case if  
    1. The shape is embedded in the content of a message via ´[needuri]/won:seeks´ 
    1. The `sh:severity` is to be interpreted as an indication of urgency/importance or precedence if multiple shapes are present


This document is based on the [SHACL Constraint Language (SHACL) W3C Candidate Recommendation](https://www.w3.org/TR/shacl/)

## Evaluating information requirements
### constructing the shapes graph and the data graph
SHACL specifies how a [data graph](https://www.w3.org/TR/shacl/#data-graph) is validated against a [shapes graph](https://www.w3.org/TR/shacl/#shapes-graph).

In order to validate information requirements, we need to define how the shapes graph and the data graph are to be constructed from the available data:

At any point in time during a conversation between two needs (referred to here as the need and the counterpart), the available data consists of all data crawlable starting from the need and starting from the counterpart. (including need content graphs, need sysinfo graph, need's event container, connection container, connections, connection to counterpart including additional data (like feedback), connection's event container, the need's messages and their remoteMessages, the counterpart's messages and their remoteMessages).

For validating the need's information requirements:
* data graph: Compute the union of all triples in the available data that were generated by the counterpart: the counterpart itself (all graphs), as well as all messages that has its connection as the object of the `msg:hasSender` property, fetched from the need's WoN node (i.e. the remoteMessages of the messages produced by the counterpart)
* shapes graph: Compute the union of all graphs in the need that are referenced by [Need] won:hasCounterpartShapesGraph [Graph]

For validating the counterpart's information requirements:
* data graph: Compute the union of all triples in the available data that were generated by the need: the need itself (all graphs), as well as all messages that has its connection as the object of the `msg:hasSender` property, fetched from the need's WoN node (i.e. the originals of the messages produced by the need)
* shapes graph: Compute the union of all graphs in the counterpart that are referenced by [Counterpart] won:hasCounterpartShapesGraph [Graph]

This way, both sides can evaluate each other's information requirements and generate a GUI (e.g. a form, a map, or a calendar) for the user to enter the data.

## Goals

Needs can declare goals that they want to achieve in collaboration with a counterpart need. For example, one need offers a taxi ride and the other needs is looking for a ride. This situation may be described as two complementary goals by the two needs which can result in a collaboration to fulfill actually a common goal of both - perform the ride togehter as driver and client. 

As described before needs are matched based on the data in their `won:is` and `won:seeks` branches. A third type of top level branch therefore is `won:goal`. A goal consists of data graph as input suggestion for the goal and a SHACL graph that defines how the data should look like after the goal is reached. Needs try to fulfill their goals in a conversation with a counterpart need after the matching happened and a connection is opened. Needs would look on the counterpart for fitting complementary goals where the data graph would fulfill the SHACL graph of its own goal(s) and where they can fulfill the SHACL graph on the counterpart with their own data graph in reverse. To fullfill two goals on both both sides one need would propose a data graph that satisfies both SHACL constraints. This data graph would usually be a combination of data graphs of goals of both sides. The other side could then accept the proposed data graph if it satisfies one of its goals and thereby form an agreement with its counterpart need.  

This structure of goals can be used to describe service/API calls executed by bots that mange needs. For instance, a bot could create a need that describes the input data for a certain API call (e.g. call taxi) in its goals SHACL graph (e.g. specifying that there must be at least be a pickup location and optionally a time provided). It may for example use its own data graph in the goal to specify that the default time for pickup is in 10 minutes from now. 

### Declare Goals

Needs can declare zero or more goals in top level branches using the property `won:goal`. Each goal has one property `won:ShapesGraph` attached to it that defines the expected outcome data of the goal. Optionally each goal has another property `won:DataGraph` attached to it that defines the input data to support the satisfaction of the goal. 

The following example defines a need that offers "Taxi in Vienna" with a goal declaration to find out the pickup location of potential customers. In the `:sysinfo` graph the need is defined having a `won:is` top level branch that describes it for the matching. Also the need defines one goal using another top level branch element `won:goal`. 

The data graph `:service-pickup-data-graph` describes a node that should be of type `txi:callTaxiAction` and sets a default pickup time to 10 minutes from now. If requested the pickup time data can be overwritten by the customer, but it describes the default case where a customer usually orders a taxi and wants it immediately if no time is specified explicitly. 

The shapes graph `:service-pickup-shapes-graph` defines that there must be exactly one node of class `txi:callTaxiAction` that has exactly one `txi:hasPickUpLocation` property which describes the pickup either as location (e.g. geo coordinates) or address (e.g. name and number of street). Also there must be exactly one property `txi:hasPickUpDateTime` attached to the `txi:callTaxiAction` that describes the pickup date and time. A taxi bot could use the default time specified in its own data graph (now + 10 min which has to be updated regularly) or the time from the customer need data graph if provided instead. 
Furthermore the shapes graph defines that the `txi:callTaxiAction` must be `sh:closed true`. That means the shapes graph will only validate successfully if the proposed data graph has excatly the from described above with no additional properties. This way the taxi service bot can make sure that the agreement doesn't contain unkown triples before accepting it and that the call to the taxi service API can be made with all necessary parameters.

If this taxi service need is matched with a potential customer need with compatible goals they could start a collaboration.
The taxi service cannot fulfill its goal just for itself by proposing its `:service-pickup-data-graph` to a customer since its shape graph `:service-pickup-shapes-graph` requires a pick up location property of type `txi:hasPickUpLocation`. This location has to be provided by a customer to satisfy the taxi services shapes graphs. 

A customer need that could have been matched to the above service could look like the following. The need is again described in a `:sysinfo` graph but with a `won:seeks` top level branch to match the service need.

### Execute Actions

Actions can be executed when two needs have established a connection. Either of the two needs can propose to execute an action (either its own or one at the counterpart) by using the agreement protocol, described in [our DeSemWeb2017 publication](http://ceur-ws.org/Vol-1934/contribution-07.pdf). An execution of an action is proposed by sending a graph to the conversation that has the following structure:
    
````
<msgURI> agr:propose {
<NeedURI> won:execute <actionURI> 
<actionUrRI> won:actionInputDataGraph [graph which statisfies the corresponding SHACL constraint]
}
````
    
The `won:actionInputDataGraph` is meant to satisfy the SHACL constraints defined by `won:actionInputShapesGraph`. The input data graph can either be created newly for the action execution (e.g. by showing the user a form to enter some values) or reference a graph that is already available in the (non-executing) need as defined by "Request Actions". 

If the executing need proposes an action it has to make sure that the SHACL constraints defined by `won:actionInputShapesGraph` are satisfied by the referenced graph of `won:actionInputDataGraph`. In other words the executing need should not propose something for execution that fail validation of the constraints. The other, non-executing, need can also propose the execution of an action (of the counterpart) and should also only propose `won:actionInputDataGraph` graphs which are well-formed regarding the SHACL constraints defined in `won:actionInputShapesGraph`. However, since the non-executing need is not responsible for the execution, the need which declares the action has to check the SHACL constraints before it accepts the proposal.

After an action has been proposed and the SHACL validation is satisfied, it can be accepted (using `agr:accepts` property of the agreement protocol) by the other side to execute it. Now the execution starts (e.g. calling a backend API to call a taxi). Each side can use `agr:proposeToCancel` to try to cancel the action. However this does only cancel the action if the other side accepts this cancel request (e.g. if the taxi backend call hasn’t been made yet or can be rolled back).
    
    

## Changes required in current system; design issues

1. Importing needs must be changed to allow for importing datasets (otherwise, we are not able to specify shapes graphs). This would also be required to specify multiple datasets with different access control settings, so this change might be useful for the future.
1. In the case of the factory bot, these needs are factory needs. The bot must be aware of the shape graphs and copy them to the concrete offers.
1. The shapes need to be validated by the bot when it is acting as a bridge to a Web API.
1. The shapes need to be interpreted and validated by the owner application - so it can generate GUI elements asking for values.
    1. investigate further, starting [here](https://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/public-rdf-shapes/2014Aug/0094.html)
    1. started a [thread in the mailing list](https://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/public-rdf-shapes/2017May/0039.html)
    1. we'll see
    1. Then again, there is [ShEx](http://shex.io/shex-semantics/index.html) - seems pretty straightforward
1. GUI generation in the owner application will not be available for a long time. So *what can we do instead?*
    1. We actually don' know what the counterpart does with the SHACL shapes it finds in our bot's need. Maybe it has some advanced algorithms evaluating them and then providing more triples, maybe not. We have to wait for messages that improve our validation result.
    1. Such messages would have to contain triples in their content graphs that our shapes are expecting.
        1. simplest solution is to add an imput field for raw RDF data in the owner app.
    1. Alternatively, the counterpart could send messages that tell us to ignore certain graphs that have been sent earlier, because they contained wrong data, or data that is no longer true (such as the current location). The semantics would be 'Graph XY (the one to ignore) is false'.
        1. We have defined how messages can later be retracted in [our DeSemWeb2017 publication](http://ceur-ws.org/Vol-1934/contribution-07.pdf) - we just need to implement that and give it a good GUI
    1. How could the bot could encourage such messages?
        1. Variant A: Keep it simple - show results - wait for triples
            1. validate the current data with the shapes
            1. send the validation result to the counterpart
            1. wait for triples that improve the result or messages that invalidate certain graphs (and thereby improve the result).
        1. Variant B: Question - Suggestion - Question loop (technically more complicated)
            1. validate the current data with the shapes
            1. create plaintext questions based on the validation result
            1. ask the counterpart those questions
            1. The counterpart answers in plain text (i.e. messages with msg:hasTextMessage triples).
            1. The bot generates RDF triples from the response, adds them to the data graph and validates again. If the validation result has improved (fewer problems), the new triples are assumed to be correct. Now they somehow have to be added to the data accepted/asserted by the counterpart.
            1. The bot sends a message to the counterpart that contains the new triples in its content graph. The semantics of the message is a 'suggestion': The bot asks the counterpart to accept these triples as true. The triples are displayed to the counterpart user and she can accept/deny the triples (as a toggle button next to the displayed triples)
            1. In cases of missing triples where default values are present in the SHACL, the bot can suggest the triples using the default values, without even asking a question.
            1. If the user accepts the triples as correct, the counterpart sends a message with the semantics 'Graph XY (the one the bot sent) is true'
